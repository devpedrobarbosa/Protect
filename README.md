* Private, unleaked duplication exploits ruining your network.
* Network raids that disrupt your server's monetization and lose you money.
* Abusive or new staff misusing privilegees.
* "Crash items" used by hacked clients to lag or kick clients.
* X-rayers and other unwished ways to obtain high amount of rare materials quickly.
* Unbalanced or poorly setup server economy.
